Mapper is an algorithm used commonly to extract information about point cloud datasets. It was first introduced by Singh, Mémoli and 
Carlsson as a geometrical tool for the analysis and visualization of datasets, and is based on the idea of partial clustering of the data. 
The result of the algorithm is a simplicial complex, which aids in the visualization of high dimensional data sets and their qualitative 
analysis.

This was our project for the course TDA.
